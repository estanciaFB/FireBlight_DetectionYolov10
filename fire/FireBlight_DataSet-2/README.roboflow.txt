The dataset includes 1091 images.
-FireBlight- are annotated in YOLOv9 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 5 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -7 and +7 degrees
* Random exposure adjustment of between -5 and +5 percent
